November 2017
----------------

* Have 2 people holding WVCC balances
* Have 2 people listed in the directory ready to begin accepting WVCC for something
* Clone https://waveswallet.io to wvccwallet.io
  - Edit the wallet creation process to have more instruction, and possibly links to YouTube videos detailing the process.
    - The simpler, the better. We want MASS adoption, here. The network effect is the most important factor involved in this project.
* Have one person outside of West Virginia helping us keep the network running by operating a fullnode
  - May have someone figured out for this. (*crosses fingers*)
